## Keygen Ceremony


During the genesis process of the Athens3 testnet, 
the TSS Signers (validators who are in the set of TSSSigner)
would need to generate a TSS public key and key fragments
(the `keygen` ceremony).

For the `keygen` ceremony all TSS signers need to be online
at the same time, and all TSS signers need to specify the same
`--keygen-block <block num>`. The keygen ceremony will begin
at block `<block num>`.
